# What is common ict?

[The Common ICT Programme helps you gain essential IT skills and exposure to different sectors, such as cybersecurity, software development, network administration and digital business.](https://www.nyp.edu.sg/schools/sit/full-time-courses/common-ict-programme.html#:~:text=The%20Common%20ICT%20Programme%20helps,network%20administration%20and%20digital%20business.) This is especially helpful for those who are not sure where to go before choosing a course and is also the perfect environment for the students to consider their different interests and other factors after having a basic exposure to the it field. More importantly, this course also establishes foundation helpful for allowing students to understand the insanely-fast changing industry and technology.       

The Common ICT Programme (CICTP) is essentially a swiss army knife that will later on be refined into a sushi knife, vegetable knife and so on. This is the simplest possible way I have to explain the CICTP. As of now, students who have yet to enter are basically bars of metal, to be turned into a swiss army knives. (This is my intepretation.)

# Important!!!!!!!!!

QTN: So I can progress to another cours after CICTP, and I wanna go AI, does that mean all CICTP will allow me to go AI related course?          

ANS: NO!!! This depends on the poly and you should check it out yourself, as to my knowledge (which again, maybe wrong) it seems that temasek poly and singapore poly are the only ones! Please check through every single one!!!! I also recommend you to ask more about the details!!!
